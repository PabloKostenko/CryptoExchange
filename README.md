<p>
CryptoExchanger is a user-friendly app that helps you stay updated with cryptocurrency rates. Built with SwiftUI and following the MVVM pattern, it allows users to input the amount of cryptocurrency they want to convert into a chosen currency, processes the data using an API, and returns the conversion result.
